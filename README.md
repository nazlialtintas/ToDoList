# ToDo-List

This project is a simple "Todo List" application that I created during the process of improving my web programming skills. It has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to better understand fundamental web technologies and take a step further in my learning process. The project includes basic features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.
